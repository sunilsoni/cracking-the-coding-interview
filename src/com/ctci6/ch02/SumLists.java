/**
 * You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order,
 * such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

 * <p>EXAMPLE:</p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2) .That is,617 + 295.
 * Output: 2 - > 1 - > 9.That is, 912.
 * </blockquote></pre>
 * 
 * <p>FOLLOW UP:</p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
 * Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295.
 * Output: 9 - > 1 - > 2.That is, 912.
 * </blockquote></pre>
